# GAME OF TONERS

Give old toners to other organizations. 

If you have a Central Authentication Service compatible 
with a [omniauth](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth) strategy 
installing got can help authenticated users to share 
unused toners.

!!! Work in progress !!!

## Possible Scenario ##

Big organization with CAS authentication (University of 
Bologna for example) and 10 divisions (departments for 
example) each with its own printers and toners.

Each user, once authenticated, can record printers and
toners present in his division.
Some toners are no more useful in his department 
(for example broken printers).

Users in other divisions with compatible printers
will be automatically notified.

## Installation 

Game of Toners is made with the 
[ruby on rails](http://rubyonrails.org) framework.

See the [WIKI](https://github.com/donapieppo/got/wiki)
